# Beginner Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my **beginner-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** skills using Python.  
The goal is to understand the dataset, clean it, analyze key variables, and extract meaningful insights with visualizations.

## 🔍 Steps Performed in This Project

### 1. Data Understanding
- Loaded the dataset
- Checked dataset shape and columns
- Reviewed data types

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Corrected data types

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of numerical features
- Analysis of categorical variables (e.g., Region-wise performance)
- Visualizations:
  - Bar plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
